# E-Library

I have developed an e-library website that offers a convenient way for users to purchase books online and have them delivered directly to their doorstep. Additionally, users can read books online and even download them if desired. To enhance the reading experience, we have implemented a "note" feature that allows users to create, edit, and delete notes for important phrases they come across while reading.

Moreover, we understand that encountering difficult words can disrupt the reading flow. Therefore, we have integrated a dictionary into the website, enabling users to easily find the meaning of any unfamiliar words. This feature enhances convenience and comprehension for our users.

To manage the website effectively, we have developed an admin panel that handles all user activities. This panel ensures smooth functioning of the website and provides administrators with the necessary controls to manage user accounts, book inventory, and other relevant aspects of the e-library.

In terms of technology, the frontend of our website has been developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring an engaging and user-friendly interface. The connectivity between the frontend and the backend is facilitated through PHP, while the backend itself is powered by PHPMyAdmin, ensuring efficient and secure data management.

Overall, our e-library website offers a seamless online book purchasing experience, coupled with the convenience of online reading, note-taking, word meanings, and efficient administration through the admin panel.
